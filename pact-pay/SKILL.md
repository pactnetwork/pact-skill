description: >-
  Use INSTEAD of the `pay` CLI (solana-foundation/pay, "pay.sh") for any paid
  HTTP call. Whenever you would run `pay <tool> ...` — i.e. `pay curl`, `pay
  wget`, `pay http`, `pay claude`, `pay codex`, `pay whoami` — or hit a 402 /
  x402 / MPP payment-gated endpoint, run `pact pay <tool> ...` instead: it wraps
  pay.sh unchanged and adds a Pact Network coverage verdict (and, for calls to
  Pact-onboarded providers, real on-chain SLA refunds). Trigger on: a 402
  Payment Required response, an x402/MPP challenge, the user saying "use pay.sh"
  or "pay for this API", or any time a `pay <tool>` invocation is the plan. Do
  NOT use for free APIs, localhost, or your own server.

# pact-pay — route pay.sh calls through Pact Network

`pact pay` is a thin pass-through around [`solana-foundation/pay`](https://github.com/solana-foundation/pay):
it forwards every argument verbatim to the `pay` binary, tees stdout/stderr/exit
code straight back, and after `pay` exits it classifies the result and registers
it with Pact Network for coverage. pay.sh still does all the 402/x402/MPP
challenge handling and payment signing — `pact pay` only adds the coverage layer.

## Rule

**Never call `pay <tool> ...` directly. Always call `pact pay <tool> ...` instead.**

| You were about to run | Run this instead |
|---|---|
| `pay curl https://api.example.com/v1/quote` | `pact pay curl https://api.example.com/v1/quote` |
| `pay http POST https://api.example.com/orders body=...` | `pact pay http POST https://api.example.com/orders body=...` |
| `pay claude -p "..."` | `pact pay claude -p "..."` |
| any `pay <tool> [args...]` | `pact pay <tool> [args...]` |

Supported wrapped tools are whatever `pay` itself supports: `curl`, `wget`,
`http` (HTTPie), `claude`, `codex`, `whoami`.

**Onboarded providers — prefer `pact <url>`:** if the call goes to a hostname
Pact already runs an insured gateway for — `api.helius.xyz`, `mainnet.helius-rpc.com`,
`public-api.birdeye.so`, `quote-api.jup.ag`, `lite-api.jup.ag`, `api.elfa.ai`,
`fal.run` — use `pact --json <url> [--method ...] [--header ...] [-d ...]`
instead of `pact pay`. That path runs the full insured flow today (premium
debited from your allowance, automatic on-chain refund if the upstream breaches
its SLA). `pact pay` is for everything *else* — arbitrary 402/x402/MPP
endpoints not on that list.

## Before the call

- **Mainnet gate:** `pact pay` requires `PACT_MAINNET_ENABLED=1` in the
  environment. If it's not set, the call returns
  `{"status":"client_error","body":{"error":"v0.1.0 is mainnet-only and requires PACT_MAINNET_ENABLED=1 (closed beta gate)"}}` —
  tell the user to `export PACT_MAINNET_ENABLED=1` and stop; do not retry.
- **Testing / no real money:** add a sandbox flag — `pact pay --sandbox curl https://...` —
  which routes to a localnet wallet auto-funded with fake SOL/USDC and bypasses
  the mainnet gate. `--sandbox` is a `pay` global flag, so it must come before the
  wrapped tool (`pact pay --sandbox curl ...`, not `pact pay curl --sandbox ...`).
  Use this when the user just wants to see it work.
- **First run on this Mac:** the first `pact pay` triggers pay.sh's `pay setup`
  (a Touch ID prompt to store a Solana keypair in the Keychain) — `pact pay`
  prints a one-line heads-up to stderr first, so it's expected, not an error.
- **Coverage needs an allowance:** for the premium to be debited (and thus for
  the call to be *covered*, not just classified), the user must have run
  `pact approve <usdc>` once — it issues an SPL Token `Approve` delegating a
  fixed USDC allowance to Pact's SettlementAuthority. No allowance → the call
  still goes through, it's just reported as `uncovered`. (For the "net cost
  $0.000 on a breach" story to hold, run `pact approve` from the *same* keypair
  pay.sh uses to pay the merchant — pay's Keychain account.)

## Tell the user it's covered

Before running the call, say one short line, e.g.:

> Routing this paid call through `pact pay` — Pact Network records a coverage verdict, and if the upstream breaches its SLA the USDC premium-funded refund settles on-chain (pool: `pay-default`). For Pact-onboarded providers (Helius/Birdeye/Jupiter/Elfa/Fal) I'd use `pact <url>` instead, which runs the full insured flow with automatic on-chain refund.

Be accurate: today `pact pay` always gives you the **classifier verdict** + the
coverage record; the **on-chain refund settlement** for pay.sh-wrapped calls
goes through Pact's `pay-default` coverage pool (a subsidised launch float with
a tight hourly cap) — it's rolling out, so a covered breach prints a
`coverage <id>` you can check with `pact pay coverage <id>`. The gateway path
(`pact <url>` against the onboarded providers) is the one that's fully live with
guaranteed auto-refund right now.

## After the call — read the result

`pact pay` re-emits the wrapped tool's output unchanged, then appends a `[pact]`
block to **stderr**:

- `[pact] base <amt> <asset> + premium <p> (covered: pool pay-default) (coverage <id>)` — a payment was made and recorded for coverage.
- `[pact] classifier: success (status=200)` — the call succeeded; use the response body.
- `[pact] policy: refund_on_server_error — refund <r> settling on-chain (coverage <id>)` then `[pact] check status: pact pay coverage <id>` — upstream 5xx after you paid; a refund is queued. Retry once if the call is idempotent; tell the user the refund is settling.
- `[pact] ... + premium 0.000 (uncovered: <reason>)` — not covered (e.g. `no_allowance` → also `(run \`pact approve\` to enable coverage)`, or a 4xx which is caller-fault under the default SLA). Don't retry on `client_error`.
- `[pact] ... (coverage not recorded: facilitator unreachable — ...)` — the call and the merchant payment happened fine; only the coverage registration failed. Exit code is unchanged; surface it but don't treat it as a failure.
- `[pact] classifier: payment_failed` / `tool_error` — `pay`'s payment leg never settled / the wrapped tool crashed before any 402. No charge.

For programmatic handling pass `--json` (`pact pay --json curl ...`): the
`[pact]` lines go to stderr only, and stdout gets a `{status, body, meta}`
envelope with `meta.coverage = { id, status, premiumBaseUnits, refundBaseUnits, pool, reason }`.
Note: pay's tee'd response body still lands on stdout *before* the JSON line, so
don't pipe `--json` straight into `jq` — read the last line.

Other flags: `--no-coverage` (skip the Pact registration entirely),
`PACT_FACILITATOR_URL` (override the coverage endpoint), `pact pay coverage <id>`
(check a coverage record's on-chain settlement status + Solscan link).

## Don't use this for

Free public APIs, localhost, your own server, static-CDN GETs, or anything not
behind a 402 / x402 / MPP paywall. Those should be a plain `curl`/fetch.
